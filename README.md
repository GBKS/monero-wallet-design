# Monero Wallet Design proposal

UI design proposal for the official wallet for the Monero cryptocurrency. This came out of a quick, just-for-fun restyling of the wallet, but hopefully it can turn into something bigger with the help of you and other designers and developers. After all, Monero is badass softare and deserves a badass interface.

This repository is intended as a starting point. You're invited to join and contribute to the design and/or development. If you have suggestions on better ways to collaborate on the design of this wallet, let's talk. Monero needs you.

## Prerequisites

Sketch is needed to view or edit the design files. There are also static PNGs of all screens in the 'screens' folder.

## Collaboration

This repo is an open invitation for designers and developers to join and contribute. There is no one best way to contribute, so don't feel like you first need to figure it all out before you can help. Just jump in and make a difference.

Github is built for developers. The tools and process of design is a little different, so the design collaboration needs to use Github a differently. For example, merging design files does not work the same way as merging code. A little effort to keep things organizing by everyone involved should go a long way.

Right now it's just one person contributing to this repo. So you can make a big difference.
