This design now lives on Figma. [See here](https://www.figma.com/c/file/775423808468574409).

Figma is cross-browser and adding collaboration features that suit the open-source nature of Monero well. It also includes export tools for developers, removing the need for other tools previously used. This repo is kept purely as an archive.

# Monero GUI Wallet Design

These are my working design files for the [Monero desktop wallet](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui). The design is mostly implemented as designed here, but this repository also includes a few future design explorations.

You are invited to join and contribute to the design and/or development. If you have suggestions on better ways to collaborate on the design of this wallet, let's talk. Monero needs you.

## Prerequisites

Sketch is needed to view or edit the design files. There are also static PNGs of all screens in the 'screens' folder. There is also a [Zeplin project](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5a0777492a92d8ac5beb3125) for exporting assets for development. Zeplin requires email invites for access, just reach out if you'd like to get added.

## Collaboration

This repo is an open invitation for designers and developers to join and contribute. There is no one best way to contribute, so don't feel like you first need to figure it all out before you can help. Just jump in and make a difference.

Github is built for developers. The tools and process of design is a little different, so the design collaboration needs to use Github a differently. For example, merging design files does not work the same way as merging code. A little effort to keep things organizing by everyone involved should go a long way.

Right now it's just one person contributing to this repo. So you can make a big difference.
